# SPRINT1.06 Java Generics

In this task, we practice the basic concepts of **Java Generics**, comparing non-generic implementations with generic methods in order to understand type safety, flexibility, and code reusability.

## TASK 1 — LEVEL 1

### 📌 Exercise Statement

**Exercise 1 — Non-generic class**

1. Create a class called `NoGenericMethods` that stores three elements of the same type.
2. Initialize the elements through a constructor.
3. Provide getter methods to access each element.
4. Verify from the `main` method that the elements can be passed to the constructor in any order.

This exercise focuses on understanding the limitations of non-generic code before introducing generics.

## TASK 2 — LEVEL 1

### 📌 Exercise Statement

**Exercise 2 — Generic method**

1. Create a `Person` class with the attributes `name`, `surname`, and `age`.
2. Create a class called `GenericMethods` with a **static generic method** that accepts three parameters of generic type.
3. Print the received parameters inside the method.
4. From the `main` method, call the generic method using different data types (objects, strings, and numeric values) and in different orders.

This exercise demonstrates how generic methods allow working with multiple data types safely and flexibly.
